Welcome to My GitHub Repository
Hey there! I'm Hofni Gideon, a Computer Science Graduate with over 5 years of experience in the IT industry. After a pause in my projects since 2019 due to the challenges of Covid, work commitments, and the loss of my mother in 2021, I'm now rejuvenated and ready to dive back into the world of technology.

About Me
I have a background in IT support, specializing in networking, hardware, and software. My skills extend to development, and I'm currently rekindling my passion for coding and software engineering.
